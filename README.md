# ElectricVehicles

#Description of our Data
Our dataset was retrieved through the Washington State Department of Licensing from (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The data contained a variety of data types. Starting with the string data type dimension, we had the vehicle registration's county, city, state, model, make, electric vehicle type (EV or hybrid), and the electric utility. On the other hand, dimensions which were a whole number integer data type were electric range, base msrp, vehicle ID, postal code and model year. 

#Question 1
Based on both of the vehicle types, what would be the average electric range that a consumer can get from each make? What would be the top-3 makes with the most electric range?

Importance: 

When a consumer gets into the buying market for a vehicle, the consumer wants to collect data on different vehicle types and how much value the purchase would be overall. The importance of hybrid and electric vehicles and the defining factor is their electric range. We went with calculating the average electric range for each make to see which makes come out on top. A consumer can be overwhelmed with the buying process of vehicles in general, so we went ahead and created the top-3 makes with the most average electric range to get rid of some of the data which was useless to us or not reported.

Based on this graph, we can view each make and the average electric range that each make has to offer. We can see that pulling the average data even though some makes have different models which have different ranges barely skewed the data.

I love data. This is one of the reasons why. We can see based on this graph that we actually got a top-4 for the electric ranges for hybrids and EVs. 


2. In the past couple of years, how has the prices of both electric and hybrid vehicles changed? Since, prices have a direct correlation with the quality of a vehicle, how has the price a vehicle affected the electric range of a vehicle?

Importance: 
As many consumers view the electric car change as something that is "futuristic" or "unrealistic", viewing the price changes lets us know how electric cars have flourished. As we can see that the price in the early years of production was really high but we can see as the prices decrease, the electric car world has became affordable for every driver. People have the stigma that you have to be weathly to purchase an electric vehicle, which is totally not true. As we can see, companies are trying to push this stigma out of the consumer's mind. We as a collective whole need to understand that the world needs to adapt to what is happening. As a carbon footprint of human beings is getting worse, we can make small changes like these to better the gas and emissions and overall improve the air quality of where we live. Electric vehicles are the next beautiful thing.
