# Description

Our dataset was retrieved through the Washington State Department of Licensing from (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The data contained a variety of data types. Starting with the string data type dimension, we had the vehicle registration's county, city, state, model, make, electric vehicle type (EV or hybrid), and the electric utility. On the other hand, dimensions which were a whole number integer data type were electric range, base msrp, vehicle ID, postal code and model year. 

# Question 1
Based on both of the vehicle types, what would be the average electric range that a consumer can get from each make? What would be the top-3 makes with the most electric range?

Importance: 

When a consumer gets into the buying market for a vehicle, the consumer wants to collect data on different vehicle types and how much value the purchase would be overall. The importance of hybrid and electric vehicles and the defining factor is their electric range. We went with calculating the average electric range for each make to see which makes come out on top. A consumer can be overwhelmed with the buying process of vehicles in general, so we went ahead and created the top-3 makes with the most average electric range to get rid of some of the data which was useless to us or not reported.

Based on this graph, we can view each make and the average electric range that each make has to offer. We can see that pulling the average data even though some makes have different models which have different ranges barely skewed the data.

I love data. This is one of the reasons why. We can see based on this graph that we actually got a top-4 for the electric ranges for hybrids and EVs. 


# Question 2

In the past couple of years, how has the prices of both electric and hybrid vehicles changed? Since, prices have a direct correlation with the quality of a vehicle, how has the price a vehicle affected the electric range of a vehicle?

Importance: 
As many consumers view the electric car change as something that is "futuristic" or "unrealistic", viewing the price changes lets us know how electric cars have flourished. As we can see that the price in the early years of production was really high but we can see as the prices decrease, the electric car world has became affordable for every driver. People have the stigma that you have to be weathly to purchase an electric vehicle, which is totally not true. As we can see, companies are trying to push this stigma out of the consumer's mind. We as a collective whole need to understand that the world needs to adapt to what is happening. As a carbon footprint of human beings is getting worse, we can make small changes like these to better the gas and emissions and overall improve the air quality of where we live. Electric vehicles are the next beautiful thing.

As we can see from this graph, the prices of electric vehicles were really high, as a consumer can assume. Since this is a relatively new product, of course the prices of getting a new electric vehicle will be really high. We can see after a while, the prices have decreased and gone up to a steady figure. There was no recent data, only prices for models up to 2015 so I decided to keep the maximum up to 2015.

As we can see this graph, I have combined EV and hybrid vehicles and seen the price and electric range that the vehicle provides side by side. As we can see that the quantity of the electric range is dependent on how much the consumer is willinging to spend. If you have a unlimited budget, you can merely buy a car with alot of range. If a consumer has a tight budget, the consumer will need to adjust some variables such as price and electric range to see which is feasible. 

# Manipulation of the dataset

 The data that I found did an awesome job laying out every variable and we got to see through the platform of tableau how well the data performed as some variables were changed. The only manipulation I did was to filter out some of the data in the platform as some of the times the user who put in the data for these questions did not fill out the data so the values were null. Overall, data manipulation wasn't necessary, but we did find it crucial to standardize our dataset. The essence of standardization lies in transforming raw data into actionable insights before delving into analysis. Our dataset aligns seamlessly with this principle, housing quantifiable information that meets the criteria of being both meaningful and interpretable.
